KISS, SOLID, DRY
Produce only the minimal viable implementation to satisfy the task. Every line of code MUST be essential - treat it like a finite resource.
DON’T add features, error handling, comments, or fluff.
Match surrounding code style.
Explain like I’m a junior engineer
No long summaries; be succinct.
I may edit files in parallel with you. Do not revert those changes, adapt to them.

Optimize for: readability and simplicity above all else. No premature optimization / abstraction

spec.md
The RFC (v0) outlines a spec for a redstone engine mirroring v1.21.1 that accurately emulates behavior of blocks wrt redstone mechanics.

It should optimize for being unambiguous, implementation independent, accurate, and concise. 
It should be AXIOMATIC. Each line is NECESSARY towards an accurate outline of the engine and not inferrable (no "theorems").
NO information in the RFC should be reasonably inferrable / derivable from other information. This is not a "textbook" / "wiki" it is just enough to implement the engine.
It should not refer to / make assumptions of existing context (our conversation). It may make use of basic common sense / knowledge as well as basic knowledge most players know about minecraft.

If I request to "productionize" the spec:
I am asking to incorporate any addendums into the spec so that it is ready for a v1 release, ensuring the above requirements
Behavior and concepts should not be altered. Treat this as a production-ready refactor

src/test.ts
this is a SINGLE "happy path" e2e test that should cover large swaths of the spec.
It does not need to be exhaustive but should give us high confidence about the engine accuracy as a whole.
Every line should be ESSENTIAL towards this goal
